This Android Quiz App, built using Java, provides an engaging quiz experience with multiple login options, including Google authentication, guest access, and an admin mode (default credentials: username: admin, password: admin). 
The app dynamically generates quiz questions based on the current SQLite database, presenting users with three answer choices for each question.

Key features include:
- Timed Quiz: Users answer questions within a time limit, enhancing challenge and engagement.
- Score Tracking: High scores and question counts are displayed, motivating users to improve.
- Admin Access: Admins can manage and update questions directly in-app or externally through the SQLite database engine.

This project showcases database integration, secure login features, and a responsive, user-friendly interface tailored for interactive learning.
